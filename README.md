# Design-Lab
Here, we use RF transmitter and receiver modules. 
We take sequence to be transmitted through Arduino Serial and then transmit the data.
The transmitted data is then received and then processed through the Arduino and then displayed on the LCD screen.
We also have 4 LEDs on both sides if one wants to transmit and receive 4-bit numbers.
